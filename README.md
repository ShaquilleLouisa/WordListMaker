# WordListMaker
## Functionalities:
This is a Python application that offers the following functionalities:

## Conversions between PDF and Excel files.
* Removing Katakana words from Japanese Vocabulary study lists.
* Shuffling the rows in an Excel file.
* Generating an Anki deck (Work in Progress).
* Removing a list of entries from a Japanese Vocabulary Excel file.
## How to Use:
The purpose of this application is to create Japanese vocabulary lists in PDF format, excluding words that have already been memorized. Randomized shuffling of the list can enhance the learning process. Additionally, checkmarks can be added to the newly created PDF to facilitate the removal of memorized words.

## How to Run:
To run this application, execute the "WordListMaker.py" file. The addition of checkboxes to the PDF file can be accomplished by running the "AddCheckBoxes.py" file, which uses the "output.pdf" file created by "WordListMaker.py."

## Disclaimer:
This application has only been tested using the Japanese N3 level vocabulary PDF from the [Tanos](https://www.tanos.co.uk/jlpt/jlpt3/vocab/VocabList.N3.pdf) website.
